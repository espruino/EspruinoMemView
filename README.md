Espruino Memory Viewer
=======================

![](img/vis.png)

This tool allows you to connect to an [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/)/Bangle.js device via Web Bluetooth
and then display the contents of RAM as a Network.

It's a good way to look into your code and see if there's anything obviously using memory that shouldn't be.
