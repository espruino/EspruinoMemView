Espruino Memory Viewer
=======================

![](img/vis.png)

This tool allows you to connect to an [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/)/Bangle.js device via Web Bluetooth
and then display the contents of RAM as a Network.

It's a good way to look into your code and see if there's anything obviously using memory that shouldn't be.

To use it:

* [Open this link](https://espruino.github.io/EspruinoMemView/vis.html)
* Click `Connect`
* Wait...
* Then click and drag and use the mousewheel to zoom


* **RED** are `global` and `hidden` objects in Espruino
* **GREEN** are functions
